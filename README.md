When creating or adding exercises the user can choose from cardio or resistance exercises. If they are tracking a resistance exercise the user will be prompted to enter the name, weight, sets, reps, and duration of that specific exercise. If they are tracking a cardio exercise the user will be prompted to add the exercise name, distance, and duration.
